Description:
When a user is informed of critical operations than the user can determine
if the notification is send by his own actions, or that the notifucation indicates 
potential compromitation of his user account.

Solution:

Verify that secure notifications are sent to users after updates
to authentication details, such as credential resets, email or address changes,
logging in from unknown or risky locations. 

The use of push notifications - rather than SMS or email - is preferred, but in the 
absence of push notifications, SMS or email is acceptable as long as no sensitive information is disclosed 
in the notification.
